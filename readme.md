# React Redux Firebase Boilerplate

This project is a personal starter I want/need that is a bit more robust than [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has made some opinionated choices, such as using Firebase for data and auth. I've created and deleted more starters than I can count so treat this as transient.

## Out of the box

- React

- Firebase for data and auth
- Jest and Enzyme for testing
